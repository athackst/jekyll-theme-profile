# Welcome to the Test Post

This is a sample post intended to test various styles provided by the theme. It includes headings, paragraphs, lists, code snippets, and more. Everything here is meant to look ordinary while helping you ensure your styles are working as expected.

## Subheading Example

This is a paragraph with **bold text**, *italic text*, and a [link to jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Text should wrap correctly, and spacing should be consistent.

### Another Subheading

Lists are a key part of content. Here’s an unordered list:

- Apples
- Bananas
- Grapes

And an ordered list:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

#### Inline Elements

Some `inline code` for testing, along with `anotherSnippet` right here.

##### Code Block

```html
<div class="example">
  <p>Hello, world!</p>
</div>
```

###### Blockquote

> This is a blockquote. It should stand out from the rest of the content.

## Tables

Tables should be styled appropriately and should scroll if they are too wide.

| Product  | Price | Stock        |
|----------|-------|--------------|
| Chair    | $50   | In stock     |
| Table    | $150  | Low stock    |
| Lamp     | $30   | Out of stock |

### Images

Small images should be shown at their actual size.

Large images should always scale down and fit in the content container.

### Footnotes
Here's a simple footnote,[^1] and here's a longer one.[^2]

[^1]: This is the first footnote.

[^2]: Here's one with multiple paragraphs and code.
     Indent paragraphs to include them in the footnote.
     `my code`
     Add as many paragraphs as you like.

## Final Thoughts

This post covers common content types.
