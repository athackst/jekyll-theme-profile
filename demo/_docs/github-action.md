You can also use this with GitHub actions. Below is a typical workflow file

```yaml
# Sample workflow for building and deploying a Jekyll site to GitHub Pages
name: Docs

on:
  # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch
  push:
    branches: ["main"]

  # Run on every pull request
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, reopened, synchronize ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

  schedule:
    # This will refresh your repositories and other user information every day
    # * is a special character in YAML so you have to quote this string
    # Generate from https://crontab.guru/
    #        ┌───────────── minute (0 - 59)
    #        │ ┌───────────── hour (0 - 23)
    #        │ │ ┌───────────── day of the month (1 - 31)
    #        │ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1 - 12 or JAN-DEC)
    #        │ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of the week (0 - 6 or SUN-SAT)
    #        │ │ │ │ │
    #        │ │ │ │ │
    #        │ │ │ │ │
    #        * * * * *
    - cron: "0 0 * * *"
